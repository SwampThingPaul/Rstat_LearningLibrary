# rstats LearningLibrary

This repository is a living thing...

It holds R-stats code examples of things I have come across or developed over the years. As time goes on it will grow (I hope). If you come across an error or need help on a specific analysis/function feel free to drop me a line at [pjulian@ufl.edu](mailto:pjulian@ufl.edu).
